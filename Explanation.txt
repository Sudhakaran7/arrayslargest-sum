You are given with array, with positive integers and a integer 
you can split the array into V non-empty continuous subarrays. 
Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these V subarrays.
Constraint: 1< size of array <1000

Input description:
N the size of the array
list of positive integers and in next line an integer V

Output description:
minimize the largest sum among these V subarrays

Sample Input:
5
12 4 5 13 1
2

Sample Output:
19

Explanation:
the  V split arrays are (12,4), (5,13,1),(12,4,5) and (13,1)
among that (5,13,1) has largest sum among these V subarrays
so the answer is 19
